Foia.fyi
=====
[Foia.fyi](https://foia.fyi) is an open-source tool by Politiwatch which allows for individuals to easily create FOIA requests to send to various government agencies such as the CIA, NSA, FBI, and IRS. Foia.fyi helps Americans bypass the "legalese" required to submit a FOIA request.

## Purpose
The purpose of Foia.fyi is to make it easier than ever for Americans to submit FOIA requests. We hope that by providing this service, we will promote government transparency through increased utilization of the Freedom of Information act.

## Security
Due to the sensitive nature of much of the data entered on Foia.fyi, all processing is done client-side and no data is sent to the webserver. This prevents a potential attacker from intercepting sensitive communications, and does not require the user to trust Politiwatch (or any other deployer). **We request that you only deploy Foia.fyi on an HTTPS connection.**

## Deployment
Foia.fyi is deployed at https://foia.fyi. We ask that you link to that site (or https://politiwatch.org) wherever you deploy our software, but this is merely a matter of courtesy, not legality.
